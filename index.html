                                From this point forward, we will only be receiving submissions for the 2017-2018 online issues of Crab Orchard Review. We are still at work on the production of our last two double issues in print and will have them out to contributors and subscribers as soon as we're done. This has been a long process with budget cuts, staffing reductions, and spending rsetrictions along the way, and we appreciate everyone's patience while we work to complete these final print issues.

                                Any submissions during 2017 will be for the 2017-2018 online issues of Crab Orchard Review and everything should be sent to us through Submittable (no postal or email submissions). Here is our plan:
