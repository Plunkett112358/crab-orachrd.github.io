                            <h4>Guidelines: </h4>
                            <p> <small> The award competition is open to all undergraduate and graduate students who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents currently enrolled (at the time of the submission period) full- or part-time in a U.S. college or university. All submissions must be made through Submittable. </small></p>

                            <h4><b>Prose entry length: only one piece per entry, up to 4000 words for fiction or for literary nonfiction. Poetry entry length: only one poem per entry, up to 3 pages in length. Please limit your submissions to three entries total.</b> </h4>

                            <p><small>All entries will be screened by published and accomplished writers and editors. Entries must be previously unpublished*, original work written in English by a U. S. citizen or permanent resident. Simultaneous submissions are considered, but an entry is ineligible to win if accepted for publication elsewhere. All entries will be considered for publication in the online 2017 Student Writing issue of Crab Orchard Review.</small> </p>

                            <p><small>Name, address, telephone number, email address, and the name of your current college or university should appear only on a cover letter in the submission process which should not be part of the entry file. Please include the title of the work and the genre of the entryâ€”“Fiction,” “Literary Nonfiction,” “Poetry”â€”on that cover letter. The author’s name should not appear on any page in the submission itself. </small> </p>

                            <p> <small><b>*We have had people ask about what is eligible as unpublished work and at Crab Orchard Review we define "unpublished" as work that has not been published by an online or print publication and is not currently accepted for such publication; we do allow work that has been posted online by the writer (though we will ask that the work be taken down until after the time it is published in Crab Orchard Review) or is available online as part of a thesis or dissertation required for the completion of a degree. Simultaneous submissions are considered for the COR Student Writing Awards, but the winning entries must meet the criteria as unpublished work described here.</b> </small> </p>
